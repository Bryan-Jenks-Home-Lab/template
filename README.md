# USING THIS REPOSITORY

1. Everything above the next H1 should be deleted when completed with this process
2. Run a bulk text replacement for the following items:
   - `<BANNER>` this is the banner image in this README
   - `<REPO NAME>` this is the 2 part github url for the repo like `tallguyjenks/this_repo`
   - `<GH USERNAME>` this is your username on github
   - `<WEBSITE>` this is your personal website
   - `<EMAIL>` Your contact email
   - `<YOUR NAME>` your actual name if you're okay with having that on display
   - `<LICENSE YEAR>` the portion of the license file (defaults to included [Apache 2.0](LICENSE) where you include the year)
3. `funding.yml` is setup for me so if you want your stuff there edit it.
4. When ready to begin run the setup bash script (COMING SOON)
